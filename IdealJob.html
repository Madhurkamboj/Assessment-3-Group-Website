          Of all of the ideal jobs Team Alpha has selected, there are some notable
          features shared among them. These include:<br>
          --All of them mainly focus on and require proficiency with technology,
          as to be expected in an IT job.<br>
          --All of them involve being able to work in or manage a team.
          Teamwork and being able to collaborate is an important skill in any
           kind of job, and as this course emphasizes group work,  it will be
           good opportunity to practice and develop this skill.<br>
           --Most of them are in the field of software and/or require experience in some sort of programming language. This is a commonly sought after skill in the IT industry and an expected requirement of a job in this field.<br>
           --Some of them emphasize creativity and problem solving as desirable skills for their respective positions, while others emphasize good interpersonal skills.<br><br>

              While all the jobs are in the IT industry, each is unique in its own way. <br>

              A UI designer's job is the least technical, not requiring any programming experience
               and favoring creative and design experience and a visual design portfolio instead.
               It is also a job for a video game company and it is preferred that the applicant is
               knowledgeable about the gaming industry.<br>

               As a Head of Software Engineering is leading a team, it'll naturally be important that
                they have good leadership and management and are very involved with their respective team.<br>

                Software Development as a job requires the most technical expertise and experience, with the
                Developer needing to be proficient in many programming languages, frameworks, APIs and Cloud
                services.<br>

                The Embedded Software Engineer job is a from a company that works with racecars and motor sport,
                 and is recommended for the applicant to have knowledge of how they work and be able to read circuit
                  diagrams. <br>

                  A Mechatronics Engineer is the most hardware-oriented out of all the jobs chosen, and it
                  also unique in that it is in the field of robotics. Although some of the Engineer's responsibilities
                  are related to software, the job advertisement does recommend having electrical engineering and
                  workshop experience. <br><br></p></div></div>

                  <div style="width:1000px">
                    <div style="float:left; width: 400px">
                  <h1 style="font-size:25px; color:white; float:right">
                    How similar or different are your career plans across the group? </h1>
                    </div>
                    <div style="float:right; width: 590px">
                    <p style="font-size:18px; color:white">
                      With a few outliers, the majority of the jobs chosen by the team were software/development
                      jobs that require technical proficiency and involve working in teams. That would seem to
                      indicate that most members of the team have similar ideas of what makes an appealing job
                      to them, and might also point to the team having similar skillsets and interests in IT.
                      Having similar interests can unite a team and ease communication due to mutual understanding,
                      but a lack of variety in expertise can restrict a team's ability to try different things if
                      it doesn't fall within their skillset, as well as make it more likely for a team to get stuck
                      into a certain way of doing things, which may be inefficient or outdated.  <br>

                      In short, Team Alpha has mostly similar career plans, but whether that will be beneficial
                      or detrimental to the group remains to be seen.</p><br><br></div></div>
