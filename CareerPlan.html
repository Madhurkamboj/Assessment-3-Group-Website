                                <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">I would like to pursue a 
                                    career in something design related, as I come from an artist 
                                    background and am passionate in exercising my creativity, 
                                    studying the principles of design and making things that will 
                                    benefit other people. I have a growing fascination with IT and 
                                    believe that it has a lot of future promise, so I decided that 
                                    a job that is a mix between technology and design would be the 
                                    best fit for <br>There is no set path to becoming a UX/UI designer. 
                                    Many people are able to land jobs in the UX/UI industry without a 
                                    degree or much experience; as such the market is rather oversaturated 
                                    and there is more emphasis on standing out from the crowd. I plan to 
                                    complete a Bachelor of IT, while specialising in web design. I chose 
                                    this degree as it would allow me to develop my programming and web 
                                    development skills, as having this skillset can set me apart from 
                                    others and are easily transferrable to other jobs. During this time 
                                    I will start developing case studies for my design portfolio, as well 
                                    as a personal website. After completing my portfolio I would aim to 
                                    get an internship as a Junior UI Designer, before applying to more 
                                    senior position.</p>

                                <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">For myself, I plan to transfer my 
                                    career to IT, which will be a big challenge. I will lay a solid foundation 
                                    of IT knowledge which means completing my degree, focusing on software development 
                                    as my specialization, improving my programming and problem solving skills. After 
                                    graduating, I will try to get an internship to get more experience within a professional 
                                    work environment. I believe working with professionals can help me to understand the 
                                    industry better and improve my skills significantly. After a short internship, which 
                                    might take 3 to 6 months, I will start my career from junior position and aim to get 
                                    promoted to Head of Software Engineer in the next 10-15 years. </p>

                                     to other fields which are closely related like web programming which 
                                     I really enjoy doing. My plan is to complete Bachelor of IT which will 
                                     provide me Broder knowledge in IT and side by side do  short online

                                        It is too late for me in my working life to change career 
                                        (unfortunately). I'm studying just because I have an interest 
                                        in computers and it is something I have always wanted to do 
                                        ie to try and obtain the degree in IT. Having said that, 
                                        maybe some "fountain of youth" wonder drug may be discovered,
                                         so if that happens, I would like to work in the field of 
                                         mechatronics. Having used Raspberry Pi, Arduino and LORA 
                                         (Long Range Wifi basically), I think that mechatronics 
                                         combined with the Internet Of Things would be a terrific 
                                         and useful career path to follow. It would be very satisfying 
                                         to see something physical/mechanical that I create be used by 
                                         a number of people that would find it useful. There does seem 
                                         to be a high demand in the workforce for these skills.

                                            I want to pursue Software Engineering. I have always been
                                            interested in working in such a field. Even before starting 
                                            my studies at RMIT, I took coding courses for myself as it 
                                            is something I enjoy. My ideal career has not changed after 
                                            receiving the results from A1 and A2, and I still aspire to 
                                            work in the same field. As I have mentioned before in 
                                            previous assessments, I have also (enjoyed) working with 
                                            Arduino and Raspberry Pi, which I believe may help me later 
                                            in my career. After reading studies (last assessment) about 
                                            how heavily this position is required in Australia, I have 
                                            been even more confident that this career path is for me.
