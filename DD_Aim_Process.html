                Our aim for this project make a functioning prototype, MVP. <br>
                Broadly speaking, this project's aim is to give members of a shared 
                household the tools to plan out how their house will be maintained. 
                There are some other, more personal aims for this project. 
                In developing RoomyPlanner, our team would hope to gain some 
                experience both in collaboration as well as learning the tools 
                of app development. <br>
                While we also have the goal of creating more transparency and making
                 communication between users easier, we can't guarantee that our app
                  will be able to solve underlying communication issues. Our app is 
                  only providing the tools, it's still up to the users to make this 
                  app work for their group. <br>
                  We would need to develop multiple features in order to achieve our 
                  aim and give our users a complete experience. This next section will 
                  breakdown what needs to be done to implement each feature. <br>
                  The Planner allows user to schedule and edit events on a calendar, 
                  assigning a name, date and person to each event. They can choose to 
                  schedule a chore, bill or other, which have their own property. 
                  Chores can be rotated between different people in a group, 
                  and bills can be split between users. All events can also be 
                  viewed in a list. <br>
                  This feature is arguably the main feature of RoomyPlanner and would 
                  take priority in development because of its complexity and high 
                  demand from potential users. While there are a lot of moving parts 
                  to this feature, the main focus of development would be to make it 
                  able to schedule an event that shows up on the calendar. After the 
                  base functionality has been implemented, the different types of 
                  events and list view will be worked on next. <br>
                  The shopping list is a note document that all members of the group 
                  can collaborate on. Users can make multiple lists for their needs, 
                  and all of them can be printed or transferred to other devices. 
                  They can also be customized to have different colours and styles. <br>
                  This feature is often neglected by household management apps, but the 
                  base functionality is surprisingly simple to implement. After that comes 
                  the task of syncing the lists with other users devices, making them able 
                  to printed or downloaded, and making them customizable. <br>
                  Expenses, like shopping or rent, can be recorded in a spreadsheet, which 
                  stores the name, date and amount of the expense. They will be automatically 
                  added up and compared against the user's current budget. Existing expenses 
                  are connected to the planner, and can be scheduled to be paid. <br>
                  Since this feature is somewhat connected to the planner feature, it should 
                  be worked on either in conjunction with or after the planner feature. It is 
                  not of high priority and will likely be developed after the planner and shopping lists. <br>
                  Group Chat allows users to message each other and share files. A group chat is automatically 
                  created for each group, but users can message each other individually as well. <br>
                  This feature is the lowest priority and might not be developed if we don't have time. This 
                  kind of feature is common among many applications but is hard to build from scratch. Luckily, 
                  there are some templates available online for us to base our feature on. <br>
                  Each feature should have enough time to develop and fill in more details but due to limited time 
                  we would focus on the important parts. The important parts of this project are bill management, 
                  shopping list, planner. If we have only enough time or resources for one of our goals, planner 
                  will be the import part. <br>
                  Because paramount facts could link to planner and roomy can check on planner everyday avoid missing 
                  the critical information. <br>
                  Messy shared spaces is tough. Roommate has total disregard for cleanliness, they may 
                  let their dirty cloth lay cross shared space or leave their dirty dishes in the sink 
                  for days. When people leave the message to tell roommate clean up the mess on board, 
                  sometimes, roommate just ignore it. Set up a digital planner is necessary that you 
                  can put alarm on it and has record online. Also, it can help you to set up the 
                  boundary for the others which tell them who will be the one has responsibility to 
                  keep the shared place neat. Planner can noticed roommates that the front door wasn't 
                  lock properly or leave message that someone forgot to turn the light off without to 
                  embarrassed people. Planner can tell roommate ahead that which day who will be use 
                  public space or has party at home to organise the public space using time in fairly 
                  way. <br>
                  Catch up with roommates is the way of ice break. Create a shopping list on RoomyPlanner 
                  is easy than you just put a note on surface of fridge. Everyone carry mobile phone in 
                  these days, digital note is convenient and efficient. <br>
                  Share some cost is part of headache problem between roommates. Such as water, electricity, gas, 
                  WIFI, etc. Bill management help roommate to create bill display and notice the due date. <br>
                  Support roommates organise house routine and plan general activities. <br>
                  For example, set schedule of general cleaning on planner, split bills before due date. <br>

             <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">
                This is a powerful tool to change how roommates organize their lifestyle. People usually
                 feel lost when they move to a new place and start living with strangers. Each person 
                 has own their routine of waking up early or sleep late. Managing house business between
                  roommates is important to maintain a healthy and conflict free environment. <br>
             Things like house cleaning, bills, grocery shopping are collaborative tasks which everyone 
             either forgets or refuse to do. This is where "RoomyPlanner comes in to play. With 
             RoomyPlanner you can assign chores around the house, create shopping lists, split and 
             pay bills and other expenses, and set reminders for events. <br><br>

                </p>
                <h1 style="color:wheat; font-size:25px;">The Story </h1>
                 <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">
                    Evern though this project idea emerged from the mind of one group member, but
                     it became the group project because we all have gone through the similar life 
                     situations where living with roommates can be hard to get used to, especially 
                     for someone who has moved out for the first time.  There can be people who are
                      lazy and messy up the house while not doing any chores, or are annoying to 
                      others. The ones affected might not have the courage or be too busy to speak 
                      up and tell their roommates how they're bothering them, which only causes 
                      more frustration to build up. Even maintaining a chore roster can prove difficult,
                       as people often forget if they're meant to do anything and there can often be 
                       communication breakdown since no one is usually in the same place at the same 
                       time.  <br>
                       This project has more a focus on general convenience, and seeks to make the 
                       experience of living with roommates more organized and stress free. Users can
                        keep their chore schedules all in one place, and communicate with other 
                        roommates or manage things without needing face-to-face interaction. This 
                        can help to ease tensions between people who have different schedules or 
                        lifestyles living in the same house, and let everyone carry on with their 
                        lives without needing to worry about who's doing what or whether everyone 
                        knows what they need to do. <br><br>

                  </p>
                    <h1 style="color:wheat; font-size:25px;">The Plan  </h1>
                    <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">
                        We planned this project to be a self-sustained, fully functional smartphone 
                        app and a web-application with following features:
                        </p>
                        <h2 style="color:wheat; font-size:20px;">Planner</h2>
                        <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">This is a shared calendar for all 
                            types of events that need to be completed, whether it be chores to be done, 
                            bills to be paid or other occasions. It can display the events for each 
                            week, month or year. The events calendar can also be displayed in a list
                             view, which can be sorted either by date, person assigned, or type of 
                             event. <br>
                             If someone wants to add an event, they can click the 'add' button on the 
                             bottom right or the day in the calendar they want to add the event to and 
                             choose from a pop-up whether it's a chore, bill or something else. This
                              will send the user to another screen where they can type in a name and 
                              description, add participants by either selecting from a dropdown or 
                              typing a name, which will turn it into a search bar and deciding when 
                              it's due. When adding a bill, the user can choose from ones logged in 
                              the expense manager. When entering a chore, the user can choose to save 
                              it into a set that can more easily be selected the next time they want to 
                              assign one to someone. <br>
                              Users can also make reoccurring events and choose how often they needs to be 
                              done. If they have assigned multiple people to the same task, they can also 
                              rotate who needs to do it each week and make custom rotation sets by dragging 
                              and dropping the assigned members in order. Users can also attach files to 
                              certain events; for example if they have to do with meal prep, someone can 
                              attach a recipe or shopping list. <br>
                              Events can be edited by hovering over the chore and clicking 'edit' from a pop up 
                              that appears. This will send the user to the 'add' screen to make and apply changes. <br>
                              Notifications will remind users who have unfinished tasks to do them, or give them the option 
                              to do them later. Once they have completed a task, users can mark it complete either from the 
                              home screen or the calendar. <br>
                        </p>
                        <h2 style="color:wheat; font-size:20px;">Shopping List</h2>
                        <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">
                            This is essentially a collaborative notepad where users can make and add items to a main shopping list, 
                            or make separate ones for individuals or special occasions. They can also save shopping lists for 
                            certain recipes as well as the instructions to make them. <br>
                            Users can type in the name of the item, how much of it they need (or choose from a drop down menu) and 
                            any other details about the item. Each member's contributions are labelled so all the house members can 
                            see who made what suggestion. <br>
                            When an item on the shopping list, is acquired, it can be crossed off the shopping list and the initials 
                            of the person who got the item will be shown. The shopping lists can be marked as once-off or reoccurring. 
                            If a shopping list is entirely crossed off it will be moved to a separate tab of past shopping lists unless 
                            it is marked as reoccurring. Users can also customize their shopping list by changing the colour, 
                            font or style to differentiate one shopping list from the others. These shopping lists can be 
                            printed, downloaded or transferred to other devices for easier access while on the go. <br><br>

                        <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">
                            The user can get in touch the renter to set up the dates for rent each month, which will be displayed on the calendar. 
                            Users will be able to schedule expenses on the planner where they can divide them with their roommates, 
                            and a progress bar will display how much of the expense has been paid. <br>
                            Notifications can be turned on to remind the user of approaching payment dates. It can be synced with the user's bank 
                            account to allow the user to pay quickly from the app. Expenses can also be logged with separate tabs and calculated 
                            against the users current savings if they have the app synced with their bank account. <br><br>

                            A group chat feature that functions similarly to other messaging apps, allowing roommates to interact, inform others of changes to 
                            the roster, or tell each other if they have commitments that prevent them from doing chores or paying bills and allocate them to 
                            others if necessary. <br>
                            This can be accessed from the sidebar, notifications drop-down, or push notifications. A group chat is automatically formed when a 
                            group starts, but individual members can be contacted by clicking on their name and starting a chat with them. <br><br>

                            The user mainly uses a sidebar to navigate between features, while notifications and profile are accessed from icons on a nav menu 
                            on the top of the screen. <br>
                            When the user clicks on notifications a dropdown appears displaying recent notifications, and any unread ones will be marked as read. 
                            The user can click on a notification in the dropdown to go to the relevant page.  <br>
                            When the user clicks on profile a dropdown appears with options for going their profile page, settings and logging out. In the profile 
                            page users can customize aspects of their profile, like their username and profile picture. In settings they can set various things like 
                            notifications and privacy to their preference. <br><br>

                            For the first few days of the week 1, everyone had taken a break to recover from the crunch of previous assignment, because none of us 
                            had done a group project before and it took a lot out of the team. In our first meeting we set couple of things straight, did an overview 
                            of the assessment specifications and set some soft deadlines. We wrapped up the meeting by completing the contribution form and assigning 
                            few tasks which includes refining the team website, research for the project and advised everyone to complete SPARKPLUS before the next week. <br>
                            Half way through the week one Madhur created a basic homepage which was shown to the team in the following meeting. <br><br>
                            See the picture below: <br></p>

                           <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">
                           In week 2 Madhur continued to build just the project website, Mark started research for the login system and 
                           others worked on design and writing report for the assessment 3. <br>
                           Then later in the week, Mark showed a working prototype of login system which
                            he achieved by using Json files and JavaScript which we implemented in out 
                            project. <br>
                           In the mean-time, Anna started developing designs in Figma and shared it with
                            Madhur on which Madhur developed the home page of the RoomyPlanner. <br>
                            Following his suggestion, a nav menu was added, and the aesthetic of the 
                            interface was changed to a more minimal look that used black, white, purple 
                            and yellow as its primary colours. The Figma prototype can be accessed here: <br>

                          <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">
                            In Week 3's Madhur continued to work on the project website and in the meantime more than half of the team had to start working on the 
                            Presentation draft for the next assessment which was also due in following week. Madhur finished 
                            the homepage and started working on login and signup page inspired from Anna's mock-up  which 
                            looked like this in the beginning. <br>
                           </p>
                           <h2 style="color:wheat; font-size:20px;">Anna's Mockup</h2>
                           <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">

                           <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                            <img src="roomyplanner-5.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                            </div>
                            <h2 style="color:wheat; font-size:20px;">Later on he changed it and created a popup model by using bootstrap which looks like this</h2>
                           <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                            <img src="roomyplanner-6.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                            </div>
                            <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">
                                In the meantime Muhammad suggested to that after logging in, the website should have UI similar to Facebook's profiles. 
                                Everyone agreed and Anna started on design and came up with following design. <br>
                            </p>
                            <h2 style="color:wheat; font-size:20px;">Anna's first mockup for UI made in Asessment 2</h2>
                            <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                                <img src="roomyplanner-7.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                                </div>
                                <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">After more research Madhur came across a Bootstrap template which inspired the team 
                                    to build the UI of the project.</p><br>
                            <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                                <img src="roomyplanner-8.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                                </div>
                            <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">Then Madhur developed the UI and presented it to the team.</p>
                            <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                                <img src="roomyplanner-9.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                                </div> 
                            <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">
                                Everyone liked the Design and the feel of user interface and then we started working on the chores. 
                                After finishing the first page what user see after logging in the group started working on 
                                following features and this is how it all progressed:</p>  <br>
                            <h2 style="color:wheat; font-size:20px;">Chore Allocation</h2>   
                            <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">Anna came up with several mock ups and ideas that how this feature should work which includes 
                                    a calendar like setup where user can put in chores and users will get notifications of
                                     coming chores. </p>  <br>
                               
                            <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                                <img src="roomyplanner-10.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                                </div> 
                            <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">Another mock-up shows a list-like setup which we ended up using for the shopping list feature</p>
                            <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                                <img src="roomyplanner-11.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                                </div> 
                            <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">Since the features and design was too complex for our group's skills we ended 
                                up embedding the google calendar which gives us a lot of features like sending the event via email 
                                and auto adding in to personal calendar but it is still not sufficient for all the functionality 
                                and user also need to have google account and be owner of the calendar to create events (chores) 
                                but it still shows a lot of the functions which we want to include in our project.</p> <br>
                            <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                                <img src="roomyplanner-12.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                                </div> 
                            <h2 style="color:wheat; font-size:20px;">Shopping list</h2>
                            <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">This feature is inspired from the design which
                                 we first developed for the chores section, but we decided that it will be better 
                                 to use it for shopping feature. Madhur started working on this feature after the 
                                 chores section at the end of week 3. The design and features were inspired from 
                                 projects and video tutorials on the internet. We did some research by looking at 
                                 some examples of note-taking interfaces and making changes that would best fit our project.</p><br>
                          <h2 style="color:wheat; font-size:20px;">Inspirations</h2>
                          <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                            <img src="roomyplanner-13.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                            </div> 
                            <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                                <img src="roomyplanner-14.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                                </div> 
                        <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">What we implemented in the project</p>
                        <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                            <img src="roomyplanner-15.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                            </div>
                            <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">At the moment the shopping list
                                 feature is able to create a shopping list which utilises the Local 
                                 Storage feature of the web browser which gives the illusion that it 
                                 is saved in backend and you can make changes to it or delete it, but 
                                 in reality it is just saved on user's browser and if user log in from 
                                 another computer all the changes will not be there. For this feature
                                  to work we need to hook our project to backend which is currently not 
                                  possible due to our current skill level.</p>
                        <h2 style="color:wheat; font-size:20px;">Login/Sign up System</h2>
                        <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">It is fair to say the "tech team" 
                            procrastinated somewhat before we came up with a login process that we could 
                            confidently embed in the system. Our original plan was to hook in a database 
                            (on the cloud) that would keep track of registered users. We decided, after 
                            talking with our Tutor, that this design may not be realistic for us to implement 
                            given the timeframe. We designed a system using a Jscript that did implement 
                            a read only registered user file that perhaps looks like a database for prototyping 
                            purposes. The validation script is validLogon.js, the pseudo database is people.js <br><br>
                            The Login process checks that the email address and password has a match in people.js:
                            <br>
                            The sign On process checks:
                            <ul style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">
                                <li>First and last Name is more than 2 characters or more.</li>
                                <li>Email address is a valid format ie xxxxx@xxxx.xxx.</li>
                                <li>Password must be 8-16 characters containing 1 upper case, 1 lower case a and a numeric</li>
                            </ul></p> <br>
                            <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                                <img src="roomyplanner-16.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                                </div><br><br>
                            <h2 style="color:wheat; font-size:20px;">Expense Management</h2>
                            <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">The team wasn't entirely sure how to implement the 
                                expense management feature until Madhur suggested using a spreadsheet like design. Anna 
                                quickly got to drawing a mock-up of the feature. The user could type in the name, date 
                                and amount of an expense. They could be edited or paid with the buttons on the right. 
                                The tab in the bottom right would pull up a mini calculator for quick adding of expenses. <br><br>
                                A thumbnail of the expense manager screen. <br><br>
                            </p>
                            <div style="width: 301px; height: 201px; border:solid 3px blueviolet;">
                                <img src="roomyplanner-17.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" >
                                </div>
                            <p style="font-size: 18p; color:wheat;">In the project, we ended up embedding a Google 
                                Spreadsheet to show what the final product may look like. It currently doesn't have any 
                                functionality but can be used as a base to implement on in the future.  </p> <br><br>

                                prototype with most of the features included, though some features, like group chat, could 
                                not be implemented due to time constraints. The prototype website can be accessed here: <br><br>

                                Note: Log-in is required in order to access the features. The first name, last name and email can 
                                be anything but the password must be 'abcdef1'. The sign-up button doesn't work; only the log-in 
                                one does. <br><br>
