                                                        <strong>  What went well?</strong><br>
                                                          This project was very hard because we had to work on report, prototype , artifacts and do presentation alongside, I was worried that we might not be able to finish everything in time. But we divided the workload and made people work to their strength and interests, then all the pieces started coming together.  <br><br>

                                                                 <strong>What could be improved ?</strong><br>

                                                              As the meetings were well structured but there were times when people were confused about timings or the person who is chairing(Mostly Me) forgets to put meeting in the calendar that created a lot of confusion across the group. If in future meeting scheduling could be improved, that will bring more productivity in the group.<br><br>

                                                                 <strong>At least one thing that was surprising?</strong> <br>

                                                            Madhur: I was surprised how everything starts coming together when everyone worked to their strengths and communication was better in this project, meetings was more structured.  <br><br>

                                                             <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong> <br>

                                                          What I learned about this group is that, we might be new to IT and do not have enough skills but we do possess sheer will power and can do attitude and give the opportunity can do great things.  

                                                                  <br><br>

                                                          <strong>  What went well?</strong><br>
                                                         For the first few weeks I was really worried that things would fall apart and that we wouldn't get the project done, especially since I less control over the process. Madhur really came through and spent many hours on the project to make it work. I couldn't be more thankful for his contributions to the project. The team also came together in the last week to write all the sections of the report, which made me very happy.  

                                                             <br><br>

                                                          <strong>What could be improved ?</strong><br>
                                        Our team suffered similar problems to the last assessment, which were having some members put in a lot of work while others didn't know how to contribute, and things getting left to the last minute. I wasn't much better, but this experience gave me a bit of insight into what the problem was. Our team was lacking a clear direction, and needed someone to manage the team and ensure everything came together. It would have been better if I had gotten the two idle members, Jing and Muhammad to write some the report earlier and made it clear what results I wanted. <br><br>

                                                          <strong>At least one thing that was surprising?</strong> <br>
                                                        Some of the team members who had contributed less in Assessment 2 began to step up during this assignment. Muhammad for example, has become a lot more active in his suggestions and offering to do tasks. I was able to focus on completing the modules and trust that my team had my back. .<br><br>

                                                          <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong> <br>
                                                   Teams always need a leader, and if you don't have one your team will fall apart. It's also better to prioritize getting things done, even if it means you have to be pushy or hurt someone's feelings, because in the end everything will work itself out, and hopefully your teammates will have forgiven you at that point.

                                                          <strong>  What went well?</strong><br>
                                                         I think the determination of the group to get the job done was very important in reaching the end point. While It is natural that people have ups and down in terms of the level they can contribute with work life balance, the overall motivation was never in question. It was evident that some members of the group worked very long hours. It was great that everyone had a go at things they might not normally be comfortable with eg meeting chair and the presentation.  I'm very confident that the young members of the group (ie everyone but me!) will make great IT people. 
                                                          <br><br>
                                                          <strong>What could be improved ?</strong><br>
                                                       The task allocations seemed to chop and change a bit, which I found a bit confusing at times, but on the other hand I guess it is important to be able to move to other tasks as the need arises. At one stage we procrastinated about the boundaries of the project (eg whether to include an actual database) and in retrospect I/we (well particularly me) should have sought advice from the tutor a bit earlier. 
                                                          <br><br>
                                                          <strong>At least one thing that was surprising?</strong> <br>
                                                           I'm surprised that firstly a lot of the techniques we were allowed, or possibly even encouraged/expected to use eg fairly advanced html, JScript's etc, were not covered in the course material. I know this was one of the issues mentioned by an ex-team member before they left. The up side is that the team was very determined, and through a lot of research that is sometimes hard to quantify, produced a prototype project that looked good together with the required written material.  
                                                          <br><br>
                                                          <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong> <br>
                                                    Group work definitely has pluses and minuses, for me as a bit of an introvert anyway. The biggest plus is that 5 heads are better than one. As mentioned elsewhere, our team possesses a vast array of diverse skills that were utilized greatly. I used MS teams for the first time in this subject, and it is necessary to read all the historical chats to keep up to date as often things were moving very fast. Fortunately MS teams draws a line where last read, so that is good. Occasionally, after a hard days physical work, I did not feel like looking at a computer and attending meetings (think I missed 1 or 2), but an individual does get motivation from the team. It's like how it  is better to exercise or train in a group situation as team energy can "rub off" to the individual.

                                                      We were doing better and better when we practiced more in organizing individual task and group meetings. Each one of us contributed for group tasks and cooperated very well. The communication more smoothly than last period. The project was laborious job, but each of us reckoned with a small task then combine them in the end.

                                   In days gone by, I believed there are more places that can be improved. We can continue to be dedicated to our project or any other task on the condition that we plan ahead. For instance, we were confused about meeting time when we forgot to put the schedule on board. In that case, we had to reschedule the meeting. Confirming the tools that we were using was important, as it avoided confusing group members. Figuring out how to deliver our message to make sure each member received it and understood it was also a integral part in group.

                                 I was surprised that we had a lot of passion of this assessment even though each one of us has other commitments, we still take our responsibility and tried to get the task done ASAP.

                                                          What I learned that is we have power to challenge the unknow world without fear.  We tried our best to do what we can do and we do appreciate each other's hard work.

                                                         After the last assessment and hearing the team members’ reflections, I have clearly defined which areas of teamwork I need to improve on. During this assessment, I tried my best to improve in those underline areas, such as not contributing enough and not properly voicing my thoughts and opinions. To work on this, I have since volunteered to chair multiple meetings and share my ideas and concerns more often and with a lot more confidence.  <br><br>
                                                          <strong>What could be improved ?</strong><br>
                                                           In my opinion the program that we made together and the system we had for completing work had no problems, however each individual member (including myself) had some problems such as not completing work on time. Over all I believe there isn't much to change about what we were doing. 
                                                          <br><br>

I was surprised that despite the clearly defined responsibilities some members (including myself) fell behind and failed to meet the deadline. Considering this happened in the last assessment I am lead to believe that this is something common and we should understand that other members may have a greater workload than apparent. 
                                                          <br><br>

Every member must contribute in order to achieve the best results possible. One member carrying the whole workload leads to a unhealthy working environment.

                                                  Our group started with Emma deciding to form one in week 3 with Cody, Jing and Daniel . Madhur joined soon after, as well as Anna in week 5, making 6 members. Cody did a good job chairing the first meeting, but had to withdraw from the course after an urgent family situation came up. Emma also dropped out after the second meeting. Anna and Madhur managed to find  two more team members, Muhammed and Mark, and we decided on the team name as well starting work on the report. Things went well, with Jing and Anna doing administrative tasks and organization while Madhur focused most of his efforts on the website. Daniel unfortunately had to withdraw from the course after having to leave for his job on short notice. Our team has had its fair share of ups and downs, and has seen a few people leave the group, but despite that we have still managed to recover quickly and stay on schedule.



                                                  Effective teamwork is the key to any successful business, and a good skill to learn if you're going to break into any industry. Everyone needs to know how to work in a team, and be able to communicate well, collaborate, set up goals and make decisions together, etc. This assignment has given us good practice in developing those skills, though there are still some areas we could work on, like communicating clearly to make sure that everyone understands what they need to do, being able to see reasonable goals and stick to them, and finalizing decisions earlier.



                                                   Getting ideas across can be difficult when out primary contact with each other is online. Face-to-face communication allow us to seeing other's body language, and helps us to see the other members as real people. During this assignment we have gotten good practice in using Microsoft Teams and organizing our work there.



                                                  We believe that seeing everyone’s strength is very important in the teamwork. In our group, Madhur can build a wonderful website and Anna has good design ideas; those wonderful skills can help the other members focus on the other tasks. Using each member’s strengths will improve the project's quality and speed up solutions to a problem. Our team might still have room to improve, and it would be nice to see more member of our group take initiative in the future.



                                                  Trusting your team members is a very important in teamwork. It makes the team work together better and makes the experience less stressful for everyone involved. In such short practice period, our group’s members were able to establish a good relationship, but there was still some stress and anxiety over miscommunication.


                                                  Managing a group where everyone has an equal say is hard. And our group did its best, though our efforts are still not perfect. Most of our team has had their turn to charge the meeting and set up small tasks for the next meeting. The team made efforts to help members who were lost or falling behind. This practice is a good sign to see everyone’s strength and make it useful if we respect individuals.

                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                                                <p style="font-size:5rem;text-align:center; font-weight:900;padding-bottom:20px; text-decoration: underline;color:white;">What makes good teamwork  </p>

There is no 'I' in the team, everybody in the team needs to contribute and sometimes we have to carry our teammates to the finish line when they are lagging behind. Team members have to be comfortable and honest to each other which require regular communication and feedback, also if we want to be successful as a team we all need to work towards a singular goal and take necessary steps towards it. A good team needs leadership qualities in all team member and everyone needs to work to their strengths and in the mean-time help each other on the weaknesses. 

There is a Chinese saying, "Unite as strength." which means, "With concerted effort, people collectively can generate tremendous strength and be able to overcome all difficulties." The capability of one individual is limited. However, using each individual's strength together can solve the formidable mission which was proven by our group.  

Finding a balance between being effective and being encouraging is important, even if it can be difficult. People tend to work better in a group when they are confident in their team and all believe in what they're working for. It's good to be kind to others and celebrate your victories, so that everybody's morale is boosted. But it's also good to know when to draw the line and communicate when you have problems with another team member, though you should never aim to be mean or put others down. In the end, we are all working to put out our best work, so what we say and do should be for the good of each other and the project.
