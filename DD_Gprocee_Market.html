              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">Communication between group members is arguably the most important aspect of your project. Past experience has shown that communication breakdowns between group members is the most common cause of project failures, so it is vital that you specify at the outset the means and expected frequency of communication between group members. How will your group communicate? How often will meetings take place? Will these be face-to-face, or using technologies such as Skype? Or Facebook? Or email? Or text? Or ... ?? What will you do if you have a group member who does not respond to communications? You should expect contact between group members at least twice a week. You can always make contact more often if you wish, but you do need to know what minimum frequency is expected from all members of your group. At least one paragraph is expected here. </p><br><br>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">Overall, communication had improved in our team since Assessment 2. We found that we were sending progress updates and asking each other about their progress more frequently, which allowed us to address potential roadblocks quicker. Team meetings were held twice a week, typically on Saturdays and Mondays, and while there were a few times where members got confused about when a meeting took place, things were generally more consistent as we had gotten used to attending meetings. By this time, the style of the meeting agenda was finalized and kept consistent. We have also gotten more familiar with GitHub, though we still have a ways to go in using it to its full functionality, as some of our team is still confused on how it works.  Using a Kanban to-do list was promising, but only a few members used it and it was mostly abandoned by the 3rd week. We might want to use Trello to organize our Kanban instead, as the tab in MS Teams that we had used previously was easy to miss. </p><br><br>

              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">In order to get the funding necessary for this app, we plan to accumulate some seed funding from friends and family, as well as setting up a platform for donations, like Patreon or Ko-fi. We will also be posting promotional animated videos to draw attention from potential customers to donate. </p><br><br>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">When we have developed a Minimum Viable Product, we will release it, as well as a presentation, onto ProductHunt.com to attract investors. Our hope is that our project might be picked up by venture capitalists and get funds for the next stage of development. </p><br><br>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">There are other ways to raise funding for development, like taking loans, angel investors or pitching to other businesses, which may be considered if our plan falls through.  
              </p><br><br>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">The app will first be distributed as a freemium web service. The main way of gaining revenue will be ad placements and in-app purchases for more customization options and a greater range of functionality (being able to add more expenses, shopping items, etc). If the app gains enough traction, we will be able to expand it to a desktop and mobile version.</p><br><br>
