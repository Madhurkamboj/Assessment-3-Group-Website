                                                          Even though we had a rough start, as few
                                                           of our group members quit, we still managed
                                                            to work well with what we had. Anna worked
                                                            hard to make sure all of our writing looks
                                                            professional and kept everything organised.
                                                             Jing gave us the milestone chart which made

                                                                 So far the group is performing well, but there is always room
                                                                 to improve things like efficiency and communication. I felt as the
                                                                 submission date is coming close there is lot of stuff could have delt
                                                                 with earlier than later, In future we will try to set tasks accordingly where
                                                                 there is more time left later for improvement.<br><br>

                                                                 <strong>At least one thing that was surprising?</strong> <br>

                                                                 I was always had fear of working with other and I am not very social, but working in the group
                                                                  made me realise that there is so much we can achieve if we work as a team and if you take responsibilities
                                                                   and take initiatives, this was a very surprising experience and I am already excited for our next project.<br><br>

                                                             <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong> <br>

                                                            I learned that working as a group is a fun exercise, I
                                                             really like working with our group and attending the meetings,
                                                              we always have fun and enjoy the meetings , there is professionalism
                                                               and there is laughter and comedy. I look forward to our meetings
                                                               it does not feel like work it feels like spending time with friends.

                                                          Our group managed to get the hang of weekly meetings pretty quickly,
                                                           and doing the interview went smoothly. Jing was a great help in keeping
                                                           things organized, and Madhur has been working very hard on the website, and
                                                           has been able to get something that looks really good in such a short amount
                                                            of time. Everyone has been compliant to do what they've been tasked to do and we've
                                                             agreed on most things as they came up.
                                                                  <br><br>

                                                          <strong>What could be improved ?</strong><br>
                                                          Being able to get the ball rolling a week earlier would've been ideal,
                                                          and would cause less stress later down the line. There were also periods
                                                          where not much got done, and we ended up falling behind as a result. While
                                                           I understand that most of my team members have other commitments and everyone
                                                           doesn't have as much time to devote to the project, I often found myself doing
                                                            more work, stressing out and reminding others to do their tasks. I hope in the
                                                             future I can trust others more and get a better grasp on what needs to be done
                                                             for the assignment and who needs to do it sooner rather than later.<br><br>

                                                          <strong>At least one thing that was surprising?</strong> <br>
                                                          I found out that meetings takes more energy out of me than anything else related to group
                                                          work. While I'm aware of my introverted tendencies, I always thought I was pretty social.
                                                          This assignment has also shown me how bad I am at committing to decisions, as I was always
                                                           questioning myself and changing my mind on how the report should be done.<br><br>

                                                          <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong> <br>
                                                          I found that managing a group requires a lot more organization than I thought and can easily
                                                          devolve into chaos under bad leadership. Figuring out each member's skillset and delegating tasks
                                                           is very important early on since nothing will get done if everyone doesn't know what they're doing.
                                                            You also need to make sure everyone understands the general direction of the project, and that sometimes
                                                             means repeating yourself multiple times.

                                                          I joined the group following the second meeting. In some ways this was fortunate as two others had already
                                                          left the group, and another left later on. At assignment 2 hand-in time, we have 5, which is good. The group
                                                          made me feel welcome, and I tried to catch up with the contributions ASAP. The mixture of skills in the group
                                                          worked well, with an organiser (Anna), html competence (Madhur), good writers (Jing and all), and some basic
                                                           technical skills (Muhammad & Mark) all represented. The 2 meetings per week worked well with everyone contributing.
                                                            I thank the group for allowing me to join.

                                                          Being changed in my tutorial group a few times was a bit disappointing, as I thought it would be optimal to be in an
                                                          assignment group from within the tutorial class and I felt a bit unsettled with things at the start of the semester.
                                                          As a group, and as others have said, we have had to accelerate our output as we move closer to the deadline. This is a bit unfortunate, but probably fairly normal.. However,
                                                          some extra planning would I think smooth things out in future, leading to the best submission possible.

                                                            I'm not sure I was surprised too much. The team acted professionally and maturely at all times. Although this is what
                                                             is expected by participants in a uni course, it is great to see this in action in a team environment. Another thing
                                                              is how all the team contributed (acknowledged, some a bit more than others) without an ogre hovering over like in
                                                              some work situations. I guess that since everyone wants to "get ahead" with their studies and have probably forked
                                                              out money, the motivation is fairly high. However, it is somewhat surprising that some team members pulled the pin,
                                                               but who knows what the circumstances are around this. The level of commitment and workload did seem high for a
                                                                foundation subject, but I suppose that sets us up well for later studies.

                                                          <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong> <br>
                                                          It was great to work with such a diverse group. As mentioned, we all had differing skills,
                                                          and these skills were all put to good use. I like it how people volunteered for jobs that they
                                                          thought they were skilled in rather than being told what to do. In reverse it was good how team members
                                                           did not seem to get frustrated with members that were not strong on a particular skill. For example, MS teams
                                                           was new to me, and it took me a week or two to settle in with it, but everyone seemed to be ok with this.
                                                            "Resilience" is the key word post Covid!

                                                          <strong>  What went well?</strong><br>
                                                          Our group had a difficult beginning when Cody and Emma
                                                           decided to quit the course. After we invited Muhammad and
                                                           Mark, we had third meeting, we finally set up regular meeting
                                                           dates and clarify everyone’s task as a team. In this period, I
                                                            felt strong connection with each member as they are all positive
                                                             contribute to the group works which gave me a strong sense of
                                                              achievement. Even though everyone has different opinion about
                                                               tasks but we always made an agreement in the end of the each
                                                               meeting.

                                                          <strong>What could be improved ?</strong><br>
                                                          As a team member I trust everyone will finish their works as commitment earlier
                                                           but I believed that we still have more room to improve. When people fall behind tasks
                                                           it causes unnecessary stress but good communication will help people reduce the stress
                                                            and limit anxiety. I believe everything has solution, just need more open-mind and be positive.

                                                          <strong>At least one thing that was surprising?</strong> <br>
                                                          I felt very stressed when two team members decided to quit the course. I felt I would fail to complete assignment 2 as we couldn’t set up the tasks in the beginning and we were behind schedule. But as everyone is fresh member in this team, we work as we already knew each other few months. We spoke up when we doubt someone’s suggestion and we listened to each other. This was surprising to me and gave me more confidence.

                                                            I was surprised that Anna took a lot of responsibility that she contributed a lot of ideas and helped me to correct my grammar errors. English is my second language, so writing is a difficult task for me.

                                                            I also surprised Madhur can build a beautiful website, he took the responsibility to build most of web frame that reduce our work which he spent a lot of time behind.

                                                            Also, I appreciated Mark took the chair twice on meetings that gave me more confidence that we can finish teamwork on time.

                                                            Muhammad was quiet but he suggested that we should have done all the tasks by Thursday night that we didn’t think about before.

                                                          At third meeting, I was in charge the meeting, but I felt very nervous because I never done this before.

                                                          I spent 20 minutes to talk about my ideas, and more to say when I felt more nervous, when I sensed I should give the other group member chance to speak up, only 10 times left, I guess. But they all very kind and let me do my job.
                                                          I learned listening is very important.
                                                          The fourth meeting was charging by Daniel, from that meeting I learned how to organized a good meeting to allow everyone have chance to speak up.

                                                            I joined the group after the first meeting, and the team has made it very easy to get things done. Although having been home-schooled my whole tertiary education and have had little to no experience with working in a group, all team members have been very patient and understanding of my lack of understanding of how teams usually work together. All outstanding work was neatly organised, and meetings were straightforward and well-presented.

                                                            Thus far, the team has been working well. However, there will always be room for improvement. I have found that various team members, including myself, fall behind on meeting the deadline we give to each other regarding completing a certain question. This should be well understood and well communicated why any work may be late.

Coming from a home-schooled student, working in a group in quite a social environment came as a surprise. As we worked through the assignment and got to know each other better, I became more relaxed with the environment, and I found myself studying with a lot more confidence.

                                                          <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong> <br>

I learned that working in a group requires dedication and punctuality from both the organiser and the participants. Both parties also need to know exactly what they need to do and what is expected. As well as communicating clearly and concisely about any problems they see in the work or problems they may have themselves.

                                                  Our group started with Emma deciding to form one in week 3 with Cody, Jing and Daniel . Madhur joined soon after, as well as Anna in week 5, making 6 members. Cody did a good job chairing the first meeting, but had to withdraw from the course after an urgent family situation came up. Emma also dropped out after the second meeting. Anna and Madhur managed to find  two more team members, Muhammed and Mark, and we decided on the team name as well starting work on the report. Things went well, with Jing and Anna doing administrative tasks and organization while Madhur focused most of his efforts on the website. Daniel unfortunately had to withdraw from the course after having to leave for his job on short notice. Our team has had its fair share of ups and downs, and has seen a few people leave the group, but despite that we have still managed to recover quickly and stay on schedule.



                                                  Effective teamwork is the key to any successful business, and a good skill to learn if you're going to break into any industry. Everyone needs to know how to work in a team, and be able to communicate well, collaborate, set up goals and make decisions together, etc. This assignment has given us good practice in developing those skills, though there are still some areas we could work on, like communicating clearly to make sure that everyone understands what they need to do, being able to see reasonable goals and stick to them, and finalizing decisions earlier.



                                                   Getting ideas across can be difficult when out primary contact with each other is online. Face-to-face communication allow us to seeing other's body language, and helps us to see the other members as real people. During this assignment we have gotten good practice in using Microsoft Teams and organizing our work there.



                                                  We believe that seeing everyone’s strength is very important in the teamwork. In our group, Madhur can build a wonderful website and Anna has good design ideas; those wonderful skills can help the other members focus on the other tasks. Using each member’s strengths will improve the project's quality and speed up solutions to a problem. Our team might still have room to improve, and it would be nice to see more member of our group take initiative in the future.



                                                  Trusting your team members is a very important in teamwork. It makes the team work together better and makes the experience less stressful for everyone involved. In such short practice period, our group’s members were able to establish a good relationship, but there was still some stress and anxiety over miscommunication.


                                                  Managing a group where everyone has an equal say is hard. And our group did its best, though our efforts are still not perfect. Most of our team has had their turn to charge the meeting and set up small tasks for the next meeting. The team made efforts to help members who were lost or falling behind. This practice is a good sign to see everyone’s strength and make it useful if we respect individuals.

                                                                              </p>
