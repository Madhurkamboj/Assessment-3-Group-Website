      <h1>My parents were from in Hong Kong, but moved to Australia for their studies.
         I was born in Australia and consider myself an Australian.
         <br><br>
          My primary hobby is drawing, and I like to create my own characters and stories.
          I also enjoy watching cartoons/anime and playing
          video games, which I sometimes make fanart for or use as inspiration.<br><br>
         I gained an interest in IT from watching game design videos on YouTube, and ended up taking a game design on OUA.
          I then realized that it would be good to develop programming skills.
          I hope to learn more about IT as this course progresses.  </h1> <br>

  <h1>
    The result of INFP-T would indicate that I’m a sensitive, introspective and curious person with an active imagination. INFPs tend to be idealistic and can have unrealistic expectations for both themselves and the world, which could cause problems with setting feasible goals. Being empathetic could make me a good source of moral support, but I’ve noticed that I tend to stress out over deadlines and can sometimes take criticism badly. My abstract and intuition-based way of thinking might allow me to come up with innovative ideas and brainstorm easily, but I could have trouble committing to one idea. 
    <br><br>
    The Learning Styles test showed that I am predominantly a Kinaesthetic learner which means that I have to try things out to understand how they work, which may make my learning process a bit slower.
In a team, having high openness and agreeableness would make it easy for me to cooperate with others and be flexible with plans, but as an introvert it is also likely for me to withdraw from communication or team meetings.
 I have a natural gift for design and aesthetics, and would work best in UI, adding finishing touches and making things visually appealing. I also have very good communication skills and can easily and effectively communicate my ideas. While I am decent at understanding and applying technical concepts, I wouldn’t consider it a strong point and might need some help from my team to bring myself up to their level of understanding. I wouldn’t be good in a leading position, as I tend to follow rather than initiate, but am willing to step up if required.
