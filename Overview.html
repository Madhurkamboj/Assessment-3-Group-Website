        <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">Roomyplanner is an application for home management, specifically aimed at people living with roommates. It mainly focuses on things that need to be done on a semi-regular basis, like cleaning the house, paying bills and going shopping for items, and seeks to give users all of the features they need to take the stress out of household upkeep. Since everything in one place and easier to access, we hope that this app will create more transparency between roommates on household duties, and that they will be able to make a roster system that works for the group. Our goal is that house members won't have to worry about who is doing what or when things are due, so they can focus on other things in their lives.

          <br><br>In order to use RoomyPlanner, all of the members of the house will first need to make an account on the app, as well as joining a shared group.  Here are some of the features that users have access to.

          <br><br>A calendar that users can schedule chores, events or bills into. This is the primary feature of RoomyPlanner, and allows users to put all of the household's tasks and events in one place, so users can easily see what's going on and don't have to check everywhere to know what they need to do.

          <br><br>A shopping list. User can make multiple shopping lists that are highly customizable for their needs, and share them with whoever is doing shopping that day. A group could have a collective list and one for each individual, or even shopping list for certain occasions. This helps to organize everything for the person doing the shopping, so they know who they are buying what for and can decide what is of higher priority.

          <br><br>An expense manager. Users can log expenses and track how much they will have to pay for over a period of time and budget accordingly. Expense managers are surprisingly useful as people can often forget how much money they are spending and being able to see it all helps them to be more mindful of their spending habits and able to plan ahead.

          <br><br>Group chat. User can more easily set up rosters and communicate with each other if they have concerns. They can also attach tasks in texts in case someone doesn't know what they need to be doing. This feature might be more useful to roommates who haven't set up contact or don't communicate with each other often. It is often much less time consuming to message someone to go and do something than going to their room to tell them in person and allows you to contact them even if they're away from the house.

          <br><br>This project will start as a web application, but we have plans to expand it in a desktop and mobile version in the future.  <br><br><br><br>

        <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">The rate of people that are sharing accommodation with others is rising. Due to economic shift in house and renting prices over the last few decades, many adults have opted to share housing with others because of the convenience and lower costs. University students in particular, frequently room together, as a lot of them are international students or have been pressured to move out by their parents. With a lot going on in their lives, like jobs and studies, keeping the house clean is probably the last thing students think of.

          <br><br>25% of students report having problems with their roommates within the first month. Common problems that people sharing a house might face are: roommates not cleaning up, not paying their share of bills, being noisy, stealing other's food, and having other people over constantly.  These issues can negatively affect one's mental health, sleep, and productivity, or cause tension between house members.<br><br>

        <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px"> The majority of apps aimed at roommates are more for finding people to room with like Roomster and Cirtru, with almost none that are aimed at helping people who are already living with roommates. This forces flatmates to rely on a variety of other apps that might not fit all of their needs.

          <br><br>A lot of apps have already been made for families to set up chore schedules for their kids, examples of this being Ourhome, Cozi, Sweepy, Homey and ChoreMonster. They mostly focus on chore allocation and most do not have features that an adult might need like a shared shopping list (since usually one of the parents does the shopping in a typical household) or expense management (as kids donâ€™t have to worry about budgeting most of the time). They also tend to have childish aesthetics and UI which could be a turn off to some people.

          <br><br>There are also apps that take a more gamified approach to housework, incentivising them with points for each chore and getting users to compete to do the most chores and earn the most points. Examples of these types of apps are Nipto and CoHabit. While this is an interesting concept that could be considered for future implementation, it currently does fit the vision of what our product aims to achieve.

          <br><br>The app that is the most like RoomyPlanner would be RoomMate on the app store. It seems to have a shared shopping list, chores and expense manager feature, but it is no longer available on the app store. An archived version of the RoomMate's page can be found here:<br><br>
