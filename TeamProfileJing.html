      <h1 style="font-size:18px; font-family:TCCSans; color:white;">I came from China and lived in Melbourne about 10 years. I have worked
         in Education field for 20 years,  I grew up in China and decided to move
          to Australia as I wanted to experience living in a different country.
           <br><br>I'm interested in Sci-fi and
            read a lot of Sci-fi novels. I also like to play video and PC games
            when I have time, and like most people, I like to watch movies. I
            sometimes enjoy painting and trying new food with my family.<br>
            <br>I started to think about the programming was fun in
            the "ICT in education" course I did last year. Our final assignment
            was to build a short Scratch project to apply in teaching. I couldn't
            find a word to describe my feelings when I finally finished my project.
             Since then, I realize that programming is more fun than games even
              if it's a big challenge for me. <br>

You learn better in structured learning activities which follow a logical
sequence. You prefer lecture, demonstrations, theory and precision teaching.
You are great at integrating your research into complex and logically sound
 theories. You approach all problems through a logical process and can combine
 seemingly disconnected concepts into a rational scheme. You tend to be a bit of
  a perfectionist. You love to study from principles, theories and models. You
  tend to be detached, analytical and rational and don't like ambiguity or
   subjectivity.

                In MBIT test, my result is interesting, the value of introverted
                and extraverted is very close, means I am balance between social
                and non-social. I would like to think more instead depends on
                feelings, use judging more than perceiving. This feature is good
                on the group, because I will more think about how to get the job
                done and how to solve the problem, instead of emotional behaviour.
                <br><br>
In Honey and Mumford learning types test, I learn better in structured learning
activities which follow a logical sequence. As learning become to IT professional,
 logical thinking is very import in the work. The result showed I approach all
 problems through a logical process which helps group to solve problem in the l
 ogical way. <br><br>
In Phoenix cups test, my unique phoenix cups profile looks close equally,
that means, safety, connection, mastery are my master cups. They would give
me inner driver to connect with people that can help group members building
connection with each other. <br><br>
To achieve a teamwork, every member in the group must have spirit of teamwork,
the knowledge of how to make it works, and the action to get the job done.
Avoid the conflict, solve the problem, and make everyone feel happy is not easy.
 Use our strength to help each other is the key to achieve the goals.
