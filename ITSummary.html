          Summary of interview with Dr. Tony Liu
        </h1><br><br></div>
        <div style="float:right; width:630px;">
          <p style="font-size:20px; color:#D5807F;">Dr. Tony Liu</p>
           <p style="font-size:18px; color:white;">is a Data Scientist who specialises in Financial Analytics.
           He has worked as an advisor to Indonesian Government, state-owned
           enterprises, start-ups and conglomerates and has more than 25 years
           of professional experience in IT database technology and analytics.
           He was interviewed by Team Alpha, who asked him a few questions about
           the nature of his work.<br><br>
           As quality AI and machine learning relies on quality data, Tony's job
           is make sure that the data produced is up to standard and diagnose
           potential problems with the data. He also works with companies in
           advising them on what decisions to make and how to improve their
           performance. The majority of his work has to do with Data Piping,
           or making sure the data is in the right format, in the right place
           at the right time. The other part of it is in analytics, which is
           split into descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive
           analytics. These types of modelling seek to answer the questions
           of what happened, why did it happen, what will happen, and how can
           you make it happen' in regards to data and business outcomes. <br><br>
           Before he became a Data Scientist, Tony had done a variety of different
            IT jobs. He had worked as a programmer in for factory machine before
            working his way up to being a Database Consultant and being put in
            charge of managing a team. He found that skillset required for team
            management was much different than the skillset for programming.
            It involved writing a lot of specifications for other people to work
            off of instead of doing it yourself, as well making sure your team
            delivered satisfactory results on time.  After that he worked in a
            tax office for a while before receiving the opportunity to advise
            the Indonesian Ministry of Finance. The work for that job consisted
            of a lot of making speeches and writing reports. He also did work
            for the United Nations (UN) World Bank and International Monetary
            Fund (IMF), which was mostly about going to events and networking.
            All of these jobs ended up paving the way to where he is now,
            working as a data analytics advisor for bi-lateral trade between
            Australia and Indonesia.<br><br>
            Some financial background is good to have if you want to get into
            the Data Science field, according to Tony, since a lot of the time
            you will be working with companies and businesses and being able to
            understand the terminology and jargon will better help you to
            understand the company's needs and make more focused assessments
            with the data that you're working with. It also helps having that
            knowledge when figuring out with company to work for, as you can
            easily interpret the financial data that they release and find out
            whether this company is one worth working for. <br><br>
            Teamwork is something Tony finds very challenging to deal with.
            He compared the experience to that of an African hunter, where a
            team of people will go out to hunt but one person will end up doing
            the majority of the work (that is, tracking and chasing the animal
            until it dies of exhaustion) while the whole community profits. As
            he puts it, "If you are so unlucky that you are the African hunter,
            just be prepared. Teamwork is cruel." He also said that this kind of
            l setup is due to human nature and that if you end up in a such p
            osition you should at least ensure you get the appropriate amount
            of reward. But surprisingly, Tony's favourite part of his work is
            being able to brag about knowing things that other people don't.<br><br>
            Every day is different for Tony, but nowadays he mostly does data
            analysis, writes reports, builds models and works with a platform
            called KNIME, which is used for data mining, machine learning and
            data piping. He also likes to read and keep up to date with a
            financial news. When he worked as an advisor in Jakarta, he
            would often attend events with executives and condense data
            into a digestible form so that the business people can use it
            effectively. In actuality, being a data scientist is about recognizing
            company's needs, figuring out what information is most relevant to
            those needs and translating the data into knowledge and then into
            wisdom for companies to use.<br><br></div><br><br>

              Summary of interview with Mr. Ramandeep

            <div style="float:right; width:630px;">
              <p style="font-size:20px; color:#D5807F;">Mr. Ramandeep</p>
            <p style="font-size:18px; color:white;">
                (referred to as Raman going forward) is an experienced
                 software engineer with more than 15 years industry experience.
                 Raman has worked in different IT companies managing very
                 sophisticated and big projects. He is current working as
                 Lead software architect designing, managing  and developing
                 the software architecture for super aquation funds investing
                 company AMP. During his career he mainly focused on working on
                 software developed for financial services via .NET framework
                 which made him an expert  in the field  but his knowledge is
                 not limited to this which far exceeds in other fields of IT. <br><br>
                 Raman works for Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) which is a
                 company that deals with banking , superannuation and investment
                 funds. Specifically, he works as a Technical architect on their
                 online platform North, which offers financial products and
                 advice. He manages three teams that work to maintain the software
                  as well as fulfill the needs from the product users and figure
                  out what needs to be changed and the best way to implement those
                  changes. He also does a lot of management, like breaking down
                  and delegating tasks and making sure those tasks are done in a
                  reasonable timeframe. While he used to do more coding earlier
                  in his career, now he mostly reviews code and makes sure it's
                  up to standard.<br><br>

                    code and makes sure it's up to standard.<br><br>
                    Being a Technical Architect allows Raman to work from home
                    and take care of his family. He has been working on North for
                    over 10 years and feels a sense of pride in his work and seeing
                    how far the platform has come since then.<br><br>
                    Maintaining a live service is never a smooth process ,and
                    Raman frequently has to address production issues at a moment's
                    notice. There are also many risks involved with making changes
                    to your platform, as often something will break and potentially
                    expose important data.  <br><br>
                    Before Raman started his career in IT, he was studying arts in
                    high school. He did a degree in IT but was more interested in
                    pursuing a career in journalism and mass communication. He
                    tarted to reconsider going into IT after a few years as it
                    was becoming a more lucrative field. He remembered how much
                    he enjoyed creating websites in the past, and wanted to find
                    a way to combine technology with journalism. Ultimately, he
                    went back to Australia, decided he was going to pursue a
                    career in IT full time, and broke into the industry by
                    writing software for financial domains. He found the work
                    really interesting and exciting, and it has gotten him to
                    where he is today.<br><br>
                    According to Raman, a lot of subjects studied in university
                    will come in handy later down your career, no matter what
                    industry you choose to go into. You can take the knowledge
                    you learned years ago and apply in real situations. Even
                    things that weren't related to your future job may give you
                    inspiration or prove useful in other ways. Management skills
                    are also important to have in a work environment, and should
                    be developed while you are studying.<br><br>
                    Most of the technology used in North has been relatively the
                    same, with a few added features and changes in response user
                    demand. As such, Raman sometimes has to look into new
                    technologies, like cloud or third-party services, in order
                    to figure out how to best integrate them into the existing
                    platform. <br><br>
                    Raman's experience with teamwork has been alright, and he
                    has met some highly skilled people over his years of working
                    in one. According to him, teamwork will involve bringing
                    together many people with different skillsets, and it's
                    important to recognize people's strengths and  weaknesses
                    and play to them. You will have to get used to people coming
                    and going in teams, but if you try to be helpful to to others,
                    it might help you in the long run.  <br><br>
                    Raman often has to deal with customers and clients who will
                    often request features and have unreasonable expectations
                    about how long said features might take to develop. A lot
                    of the time he has to manage expectation and communicate
                    with his clients while making a requested feature. <br><br>
                    At it's core, Raman's work is about management and supervising
                    a team, as well as meeting user's needs in the best way possible.
