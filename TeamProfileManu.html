      <h1><br>I was born in Punjab, India and I did most of my schooling there.
         I came to Australia in 2013  and studied Diplomas in Engineering
          and a Diploma in Hospitality Management. After finishing my studies,
           I worked as a Chef for 5 years and then decided to stay permanently
            in Australia. <br><br> I love spending time with my two pet birds and I do
             try to stay active by attending 4-5 gym sessions every week with
              my friends. My interest in IT started when my dad bought his
              first Mobile Phone back in 1998, I was only 5 years old and
              the idea of being able to talk to someone on the move was
              fascinating.<br><br>
               Then few years later our town got Internet and
              my school got a new “Computer lab” then I compelled my dad buy
              me a computer. Our first computer was with 10gb hard drive, 128

               mb ram and with intel Pentium processor, it was running windows
                98. I was on that thing day and night just playing video games
                 like Mario, Dave, snakes etc. Ever since then I am interested
                  in a career in Information Technology. </h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 3rem; margin-top: 20px;">How this information is helpful to the group ?  </h1>
    <p style="color:white; margin-top: 20px;">As my MBTI Personality type "Consuls" suggest that life is great when shared with other people and this personality type forms deep bonds of love and responsibility with friends, family and neighbours. If the test is even slightly correct about my personality then I think I will be proven very valuable member  of the group by making sure that my group performs well and there is less chances of conflict and drams. Addition to this consuls personality types takes their responsibilities very seriously, treat others well and try to do the right thing which also very vital to perform well because we don’t take responsibilities and do not treat other well, we will fail as a group.
      </p>
  <p style="color:white; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">My learning style test shows that my learning capabilities are evenly balanced towards Kinaesthetic - 35% ,Visual - 34%, Auditory - 31%  which is also very good to perform in the group. This means that I have ability to  listen to others to the group and follow along , also I have no issues by addressing or performing  tasks visualising  or Kinaesthetically.
