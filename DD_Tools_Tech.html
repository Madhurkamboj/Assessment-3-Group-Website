              Madhur had basic website building knowledge which he gained by doing some 
              project work in the past. But he also learned and developed his skills from 
              building this project website and learned more about BOOTSTRAP and basic 
              JavaScript. <br>
              Mark designed the login system as he had done great deal of research to come 
              up with this solution. He had done database design course which also helped him 
              what to look for and helped him finding solution for the project. <br>
              Jing and Muhammad has been great teammates and  carried out tasks which we 
              assigned. Muhammad actually suggested  the Dashboard UI which we ended up 
              utilising in the project. <br><br>

              <h2 style="color: wheat; font-size: 20px;">VS Code: </h2>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">
                VS Code worked like a charm in this project. It has lot more functionality 
                than other code editors like "Live Server" extension which allows the user to see the 
                changes in real-time while editing the web page, "Prettier" extension which auto 
                format the code and increase readability. It is jam packed with other features 
                like direct link with GitHub repository which allows deploying change quick and 
                easy. As VS code is free so we did need any license or paid subscription.

              <h2 style="color: wheat; font-size: 20px;">Google Chrome:  </h2>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">As our project is a website/ web application we used Google Chrome as web browser to test our project. We also use it's inspection feature to see how things works on other websites so that we can implement in our project.</p><br>
              <h2 style="color: wheat; font-size: 20px;">Google Calendar, Google Spreadsheets: </h2>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">Our team embedded these into our project to show what the final product may look like</p><br>
              <h2 style="color: wheat; font-size: 20px;">Bootstrap: </h2>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px"> With limited knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Bootstrap made our project build quick, easy and professional. Without bootstrap we would not be able to achieve certain level of design and functionality.</p><br>
              <h2 style="color: wheat; font-size: 20px;">W3schools: </h2>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px"> We used W3schools for research and tutorials to build our project. Whenever we got stuck we were always able to find solutions there and make things work.</p><br>
              <h2 style="color: wheat; font-size: 20px;">GitHub: </h2>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">We used GitHub to store all of the files relating to the project on the cloud so that everyone could collaborate on them easily.</p><br>

              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">The main prototyping software that the team used. It was useful for giving us a quick way to design the look of the project's interface, while having features to make the prototype interactable. </p><br>

              <h2 style="color: wheat; font-size: 20px;">HTML, CSS</h2>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px"> These acted as building blocks for this web application and made sure our that users will have seamless experience with UI on different devices. Using a CSS allows consistency across all the pages. It is decided by the main developer to use the Bootstrap html library as it offers a great graphical experience in the UI. Some familiarity of the Bootstrap system by main HTML developer also was key in our decision to use that product.</p>  <br><br>              <h2 style="color: wheat; font-size: 20px;">JavaScript, JSON, JQuery</h2>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">Javascript is used to perform dynamic processing “behind” the web pages. Javascript accesses html fields and uses values from the fields to perform processing, using witi coded functions. In our case JS was used to perform login (eg email and password) validations. (Very) Surprisingly data within modal (child) html windows appear to be processed quite differently from processing within main or standard html pages. I think this is because data within modal pages is held only transiently. After much research and trial and error, it was decided to use JQuery to dynamically process modal windows. While it is believed that bootstrap may have some processing libraries to process modal windows, it was decided to use JQuery for familiarity and extensibility purposes (eg in case we moved away from the Bootstrap html libraries).</p><br><br> 
              <h2 style="color: wheat; font-size: 20px;">SQL Database</h2>
              <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">Database systems such as MySQL or PostgreSQL or will be decided on later stages and will be used to store and retrieve data. A relational database model will be used due to the tight constrains and relations of data. For example the system is based around house, there are occupants with the house and house chores are assigned to the occupants (roomies). It is expected the databases will reside on the cloud. The cloud has several big advantages over an in-house solution, namely security, extensibility, stability and support. While in depth personal data is not needed within the system, names and email addresses will be stored, and are considered by most people to be quite sensitive. Java(scripts/query) or PHP may be used to connect the databases to the application.</p> <br><br>

                  <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">How will your test your project? How will you know when you have succeeded? Testing is not something that you should leave until the very end; often it is far more useful to have a quick and dirty “mock up" of a project and then do some (limited) testing, to and out whether you are building the right product. If your project involves user testing, you should describe in your plan how you will find the test users, approximately what number of people you will need, and what background (if any) is required. At least one paragraph is expected here. </p><br><br>
                  <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">Our target demographic is unmarried adults from the ages of 18-30, and university students, as they are the most likely group to be sharing accommodation with others.  </p><br><br>
                  <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">At the beginning of development we will conduct an online survey aimed at our target audience. The survey would ask questions to vet out participants, (user's age range, are they studying or have studied in university, are they currently or have been living in a shared household) before asking them about common problems they face living with others and their experience with home management apps. This survey will be used to nail down the scope of the project and figure out what features are necessary and what can be cut. By doing this survey we will can be more sure that our project is heading in the right direction and will achieve what it aims to accomplish. 
                  </p><br><br>
                  <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">The priority for testing in the early stages of development would establishing the finer details in each feature, as well as making sure the app's navigational layout is easy to use and works as intended. Early testing will be done with on individual features with wireframes and have a small pool of people, likely the team's friends and family, as testers. Testers would be asked to complete a certain task in the app, and data like how long it took on average and where people clicked will be used to narrow down options for layout and composition of the interface. Various other testing methods will be employed, like observation and feedback sessions. In this stage, major front-end and structural problems can be caught and easily fixed.  After a few cycles of testing and correction, A/B testing will be used to finetune smaller aspects of the design and solidify the app's layout.</p><br><br>
                  <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">After an alpha build has been completed, in-house automated testing will be conducted on the system to catch any major bugs. The individual features as well as how they are integrated will be also be tested to make sure they work. Database, performance and security testing will also be done during this period.</p><br><br>
                  <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">When the beta version has been completed, the application will be released to select groups of testers who have signed up to become beta testers. Applications will be posted online looking for roommate households.  Groups of 2-6 would be preferred. Families or other living situations are acceptable applicants but we would mostly be aiming at university students. After they have signed up, each group would use the app for a week, after which they would report their experiences, as well as any bugs they found.  Each group would be would be compensated for their time.</p><br><br>
                  <p style="color: wheat; font-size:18px">Testing in a software's development cycle is never a straightforward process, and there may be even more testing periods conducted throughout development and even post-launch. This plan is only a general outline, and will be subject to change and revision.</p><br><br>
